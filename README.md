# CSE102: Data Structures & Algorithms

## About CSE102

<b>[CSE102: *Data Structures & Algorithms*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE102)</b> is a 1xx-level course offered to all undergrads at IIIT-Delhi. The course centers around exposing students to basics of data structures and algorithms, and how they are used in the real world. It aims to enable students to:

- understand and apply [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) to problems
- to estimate the running time of algorithms using [Asymptotic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis)
- implement a suitable [Sorting Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) for a specific situation
- apply and implement the techniques learnt in any programming language
